1. The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter so far was the idea of activity-based models in which transportation modelers use data sources to generates "activities" that help modelers ultimately help with urban planning for the future.

2. A potential investigation I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project would be to integrate further sources of data (e.g. social media data (Yelp, TripAdvisor, etc.), other government agencies, etc.) to make employment centers activity based rather than solely just employment.

3. A potential change to the approach currently taken in my current Quarter 1 project would be to create potentially different statistics that people might be interested in. While the current approach emphasizes the employment of a certain center and its travel patterns, there might be other things that people might be interested in using the data for.

4. Some other techniques I would be interested in using in my project would be potentially figuring out new ways to cluster employment centers.
